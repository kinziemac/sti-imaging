# Spatio-Temporal Imaging Application

## Java application that creates a spatio-temporal image to detect transitions in a video.

### STI-Imaging application creates 3 distinct PNGs:

- detecting transitions based on column change in frames
- detecting transitions based on row change in frames
- detecting transitions based on histogram intersection (changes in colour intensity)

Files are created within the project for each type of image.
